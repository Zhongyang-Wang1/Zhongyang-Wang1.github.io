I am a lecturer in the College of Information Science and Technology, Beijing University of Chemical Technology (BUCT), Beijing. And, I am currently working as a postdoctoral researcher, supervised by Prof. [Youqing Wang (王友清)](https://cist.buct.edu.cn/2022/0307/c8725a165375/page.htm). 

I received my PH.D degree (Control Science and Engineering) with Beijing Municipal Key Laboratory of Multimedia and Intelligent Software Technology (led by Prof. [Baocai Yin (尹宝才)](https://yanzhao.bjut.edu.cn/info/1434/11431.htm)) at Beijing University of Technology (BJUT), China, in 2023. Prof. [Yanfeng Sun (孙艳丰)](https://sist.bjut.edu.cn/info/1403/2479.htm) is my PH.D advisor. I am also co-supervised by Prof. [Junbin Gao (高俊斌)](https://www.sydney.edu.au/business/about/our-people/academic-staff/junbin-gao.html) from University of Sydney.
